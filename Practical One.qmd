## Setting Up:

Initialising my project (setting up Git, GitHub, project directories and a README)

```{r}
library(quarto)
library(projrsimple)
```

## Question 1:

Finding all the rows with missing values from the "airquality" dataset

```{r}
class(airquality)

airquality_with_missingvalues <- airquality[
  is.na(airquality$Ozone) | is.na(airquality$Solar.R) | 
    is.na(airquality$Wind) | is.na(airquality$Temp) | 
    is.na(airquality$Month) | is.na(airquality$Day),

                                         ]

View(airquality_with_missingvalues)

write.csv(airquality_with_missingvalues, file = "_raw_data/dataset.csv") #saving our manipulated data 

```
